## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).

# Setting Up Java Development in Visual Studio Code

This guide walks you through installing Java, configuring your environment, pulling your project, and running it inside Visual Studio Code (VS Code).

### Prerequisites

- Windows (64-bit)
- VS Code installed
- Internet connection

## 1. Install Java (JDK)

1. Download the Oracle JDK (x64 Installer) from the official Oracle website.
   https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk25-windows

2. Run the installer and follow the prompts.

3. Wait for the installation to fully complete.
   Note: VS Code requires a JDK (not just a JRE).

## 2. Verify Java Installation

Open Command Prompt or PowerShell and run:

> java -version
> javac -version

## Pull our repo

1. git init
2. git remote add origin https://github.com/aliyahsnts/oop-skillconnect
